# calculator
A functional calculator project built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently, the calculator can do simple math operations like addition and division and delete all screen data when the "CLEAR" button is clicked. Users can also add decimal points, backspace when a wrong number is entered, and use their keyboard to input numbers and operators.
