# calculator
A functional calculator project built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently, the calculator can do simple math operations like addition and division and delete all screen data when the "CLEAR" button is clicked. Abilities to add decimal points and to backspace when a wrong number is added coming soon.
